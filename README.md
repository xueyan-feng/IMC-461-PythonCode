# IMC 461 Data Management Transition: R/SQL to Python

## Overview
This repository documents my self-driven journey of transitioning data analysis skills from **R and SQL** (taught in the IMC Data Sequence) to **Python**.

## Purpose
- **Refactoring:** Translating data manipulation logic from R coursework into Python (Pandas).
- **Skill Building:** Reinforcing algorithmic concepts through coding exercises.
- **Documentation:** Serving as a personal knowledge base for future data-intensive work.

## Contents
- **SQL_to_Pandas:** Replicating SQL queries taught in IMC 461 using Python.

*(Note: Some code comments are in Chinese as they serve as my personal study notes.)*
